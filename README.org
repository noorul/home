I have been working on linux since 1999. For a linux user his 
$HOME is very special. Over the time I accumulated useful scripts
and other settings that improves productivity.

$HOME usually contains

1. Configuration specific to linux programs stored in dot files.
   For example .vimrc, .emacs, .inputrc, etc.

2. bin folder which contains useful scripts accumulated over a 
   period of time.

This project tries to gather all my $HOME stuffs which can be shared.
